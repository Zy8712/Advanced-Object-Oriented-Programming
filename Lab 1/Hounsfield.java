/**
 * A class that represents a Hounsfield unit. Hounsfield units are the units of
 * measurement used in computed tomography (CT or CAT) scanning.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Hounsfield scale is defined by specifying the radiodensity of air as
 * {@code -1000} Hounsfield units and the radiodensity of distilled water as
 * {@code 0} Hounsfield units. Adjacent tissues in the human body can be
 * distinguished from one another if their radiodensities differ; see
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale">the Wikipedia
 * page</a> for a table of typical Hounsfield values for tissues of the
 * human body.
 * 
 * <p>
 * CT scanners for medical purposes typically restrict the value of reported
 * Hounsfield units to integers in the range {@code -1024} to {@code 3071} so
 * that a Hounsfield unit can be encoded as a 12-bit value. This class uses
 * the values {@code -1024} and {@code 3071} to represent the minimum and
 * maximum, respectively, allowable Hounsfield unit values.
